# Kanomap
A fork of CSweb used to display a range of kayaking information for kayaking and canoe enthousiasts.

## About
Kanomap grew out of my passion for kayaking and my curiousity. When selecting where to study for my master I found it hard to get a good view of where all the clubs were and what I could expect.

I used a - now old- copy of TNO's Common Sense web to display a single layer of waterways which essentially kicked off this project. My goal is to put as much data as possible on your screen.

## Examples
Screenshots:

Canoe clubs affiliated with the Touristic Canoe association (Toeristische Kanobond NL) and the Water Sport Association (watersportverbond) are two seperate groups. So I decided to plot them.

## disclaimer
All the data I show here is publicly available on the internet either by an exposed API or shown as data on a web page or on a map widget. It is not my goal to "steal" data, but rather I want to see just how much is really out there. In some cases data was sent to me in private.

Most if not all of the data here has been edited and cleaned up. However, I cannot make any statement regarding the validity of the data shown. 

A special note to my felliow kayakers and canoeists: please be aware that some of the waterways shown here might be off-limits or are off-limits seasonally. Always consult the web, and in my experience relevant agencies are usually eager to reply to mail.

As always: respect the waterways so that it stays safe for everyone so that more people may enjoy nature. Looking at you, German boat guy.
